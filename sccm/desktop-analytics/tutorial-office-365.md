# Tutorial: Deploy Office 365 to pilot 

> [!Note]  
> This information relates to a preview service which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.  

This tutorial uses Desktop Analytics and Configuration Manager to deploy Office 365 ProPlus to a pilot group. It highlights the integration of the cloud service to deliver insights to deploy the app with the on-premises product. Use Desktop Analytics to determine the best devices to put in a pilot group. Then use Configuration Manager to get current with Office.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:  

> [!div class="checklist"]  
> * Set up Desktop Analytics in the Azure portal  
> * Connect Configuration Manager and configure device settings  
> * Create a Desktop Analytics deployment plan for Office 365 ProPlus  
> * Deploy Office 365 ProPlus in Configuration Manager to the pilot group  

If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin. When configured properly, use of Desktop Analytics doesn't incur any Azure cost. 

Desktop Analytics uses a *Log Analytics workspace* in your Azure subscription. A workspace is essentially a container that includes account information and simple configuration information for the account. For more information, see [Manage workspaces](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-manage-access?toc=/azure/azure-monitor/toc.json).

## Connect Configuration Manager

Use this procedure to update Configuration Manager, connect to Desktop Analytics, and configure device settings. This procedure is a one-time process to attach your hierarchy to the cloud service.  


### Update Configuration Manager

Install the Configuration Manager version 1810 update rollup (4486457) to support integration with Desktop Analytics. For more information on this update, see [Update rollup for Configuration Manager current branch, version 1810](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4486457).

1. Update the site with the update rollup for version 1810. For more information, see [Install in-console updates](/sccm/core/servers/manage/install-in-console-updates).  

2. Update clients. To simplify this process, consider using automatic client upgrade. For more information, see [Upgrade clients](/sccm/core/clients/manage/upgrade/upgrade-clients#automatic-client-upgrade).  


### Connect to the service

1. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Cloud Services**, and select the **Azure Services** node. Select **Configure Azure Services** in the ribbon.  

2. On the **Azure Services** page of the Azure Services Wizard, configure the following settings:  

    - Specify a **Name** for the object in Configuration Manager  

    - Specify an optional **Description** to help you identify the service  

    - Select **Desktop Analytics** from the list of available services  
  
   Select **Next**.  

3. On the **App** page, select the appropriate **Azure environment**. Then select **Import** for the web app. Configure the following settings in the **Import Apps** window:  

    - **Azure AD Tenant Name**: This name is how it's named in Configuration Manager  

    - **Azure AD Tenant ID**: The **Directory ID** you copied from Azure AD   

    - **Client ID**: The **Application ID** you copied from the Azure AD app   

    - **Secret Key**: The key **Value** you copied from the Azure AD app   

    - **Secret Key Expiry**: The same expiration date of the key   

    - **App ID URI**: This setting should automatically populate with the following value: `https://cmmicrosvc.manage.microsoft.com/`  
  
   Select **Verify**, and then select **OK** to close the Import Apps window. Select **Next** on the App page of the Azure Services Wizard.  

4. On the **Diagnostic Data** page, configure the following settings:  

    - **Commercial ID**: this value should automatically populate with your organization's ID  

    - **Windows 10 diagnostic data level**: select at least **Enhanced (Limited)**  

    - **Allow Device Name in diagnostic data**: select **Enable**  
  
   Select **Next**. The **Available functionality** page shows the Desktop Analytics functionality that's available with the diagnostic data settings from the previous page. Select **Next**.  

5. On the **Collections** page, configure the following settings:  

    - **Display name**: The Desktop Analytics portal displays this Configuration Manager connection using this name. Use it to differentiate between different hierarchies. For example, *test lab* or *production*.  

    - **Target collection**: This collection includes all devices that Configuration Manager configures with your commercial ID and diagnostic data settings. It's the full set of devices that Configuration Manager connects to the Desktop Analytics service.  

    - **Devices in the target collection use a user-authenticated proxy for outbound communication**: By default, this value is **No**. If needed in your environment, set to **Yes**.   

    - **Select specific collections to synchronize with Desktop Analytics**: Select **Add** to include additional collections. These collections are available in the Desktop Analytics portal for grouping with deployment plans. Make sure to include pilot and pilot exclusion collections.  

        These collections continue to sync as their membership changes. For example, your deployment plan uses a collection with a Windows 7 membership rule. As those devices upgrade to Windows 10, and Configuration Manager evaluates the collection membership, those devices drop out of the collection and deployment plan.  

6. Complete the wizard.  

Configuration Manager creates a settings policy to configure devices in the Target Collection. This policy includes the diagnostic data settings to enable devices to send data to Microsoft. By default, clients update policy every hour. After receiving the new settings, it can be several hours more before the data is available in Desktop Analytics.

Monitor the configuration of your devices for Desktop Analytics. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Software Library** workspace, expand the **Microsoft 365 Servicing** node, and select the **Connection Health** dashboard.  

Configuration Manager synchronizes any Desktop Analytics deployment plans within 15 minutes of creating the connection. In the Configuration Manager console, go to the **Software Library** workspace, expand the **Microsoft 365 Servicing** node, and select the **Deployment Plans** node. 



## Create a Desktop Analytics deployment plan

Use this procedure to create a deployment plan in Desktop Analytics.

1. Open the [Desktop Analytics portal](https://aka.ms/m365aprod). Use credentials that have at least **Workspace Contributors** permissions.  

2. Select **Deployment Plans** in the Manage group.  

3. In the **Deployment Plans** pane, select **Create**.  

4. In the **Create deployment plan** pane, configure the following settings:  

    - **Name**: A unique name for the deployment plan, for example `Office 365 pilot`  

    - **Products and versions**: Select the **Office** product, and the latest available recommended version. For example, **Office 365 clients, version 1808 (recommended)**.  

    - **Device groups**: Select one or more groups, and then select **Set as Target Groups**. Groups with **sccm** as the source are collections synchronized from Configuration Manager.  

    - **Readiness rules**: These rules help to determine which devices qualify for upgrade. Select **Office Applications** and configure the following settings:  

        - Update Office 365 ProPlus from 32-bit to 64-bit. This setting only applies to devices running a 64-bit version of Windows. The default setting is **Yes**.  

        - When updating from an older version of Office, leave older deprecated Office apps. This behavior applies even if those apps don't exist in the newer version of Office. The default setting is **No**.  

        - Low install count threshold for your Office add-ins. The default threshold is `2%`. Add-ins below this threshold are automatically set to *Low install count*. Desktop Analytics doesn't validate these add-ins during the pilot. 

            If an add-in is installed on a higher percentage of computers than this threshold, the deployment plan marks the add-in as *Noteworthy*. Then you can decide its importance to test during the pilot phase.   

    - **Completion date**: Choose the date by which Office should be fully deployed to all the targeted devices.  

5. Select **Create**. The new plan appears in the list of deployment plans while its being processed. Processing can take up to 48 hours before you can proceed to the next step.  

6. Open the deployment plan by selecting its name.  

7. On the deployment plan menu, in the **Prepare** group, select **Identify importance**.  

    1. On the **Office Add-ins** tab, select to show only **Not Reviewed** assets.  

    2. Select each add-in, and then select **Edit**. You can select more than one app to edit at the same time.   

    3. Choose an importance level from the **Importance** list. If you want Desktop Analytics to validate the add-in during the pilot, select **Critical** or **Important**. It doesn't validate add-ins marked as **Not Important**. Consider the compatibility risk and other plan insights when assigning importance levels.  

        When assigning importance levels, you can also choose the Upgrade decision.  

    4. Select **Save** when complete.  

8. On the deployment plan menu, in the **Prepare** group, select **Identify pilot**.  

    1. Review the recommended devices for the pilot.  

    2. Select each device, and select **Add to Pilot**. If you disagree with the recommendation, select **Replace**.  

        For more information on how Desktop Analytics makes these recommendations, select the information icon in the top right corner of the **Identify pilot** pane.
